        <p>My name is Nikki. I am 31 years old, I grew up in Orem, Utah, and currently live in Saratoga Springs, Utah. I
            have
            been married to my husband, Alex, for 8 years. We have 3 mini pigs; Lilly, Booker, and Piper that are our
            babies.</p>

        <p>I love educating people on mini pigs, especially because there is a lot of misinformation out there. I run a
            website
            called <a href="http://pigipedia.org/" target="_blank">www.pigipedia.org</a>, that is a wiki you can search
            for
            general information, as well as specific health conditions on mini pigs. I also run a Facebook page of the
            same
            name, where you can ask questions to knowleable admins as well as current mini pig owners.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love to play video games. My current obession is a game called <a
